class_name Cloak
extends Node2D
## The hero's cloak, a layer of its own over the body sets (paper doll, design
## bible 13.4): a cape of two verlet chains hung from the frame's neck and back
## points, so it trails real movement, and a hood that is down in a town and
## up anywhere else (Sean, 2026-10-27), raised or lowered over HOOD_TIME when
## that changes. Shapes from Sean's side views (/mnt/project-files/armor/
## cloak-hood-up.jpg and cloak-hood-down.jpg): ankle length, flaring behind,
## gold trim down the front edge and the hem, a brooch at the shoulder, a
## pointed hood, and down, a cowl bunched at the nape. Under a helmet the hood stays down. It takes the worn dye's
## color; Warden Green is its own. The ranger's sheet draws its own cloak, so
## this shows only while a body set plays.

## (damping too works against the body's own motion, and the wind gives the
## lean), so a sudden pull (a landing's squash) drags the cape instead of
## whipping it.
