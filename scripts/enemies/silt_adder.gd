class_name SiltAdder
extends Enemy
## A Silt Adder (design bible 7, pass 273): the original's serpent that floats up and
## down, most often over the ladders. A sea-green hooded serpent the length of
## a man, it rises and sinks along its own column, so a climb past it is timed
## to its swing. When you are level with it and in front, within about seven
## tiles, it draws its head back and flares its hood with a hiss (telegraph),
## then strikes straight out along that level, and glides back to its column.
## The strike is a bite, and a shield's parry meets it like any blade's: no
## harm, and the serpent reels (pass 274). Drawn from its PixelLab sheet (art pass 2).
## As in the original, a slain Silt Adder always leaves the largest bread there is,
## a great loaf (pass 281).

## How far it floats above and below its home, and how long one swing takes.
