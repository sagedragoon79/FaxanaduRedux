extends Enemy
## A Shade Knight of Vorrhallow (design bible 7): the drowned ghost of one of King
## Vorrund's household guard, still in his armour, a tower shield on his left arm.
## A parry fight. His shield turns every blow from the front. He advances behind
## it, then draws his blade back (it glows: the telegraph) and thrusts, then
## cuts again. Parry either and he reels, shield wide, open to every blow.
## Let the pair finish and he stands winded a moment, shield low. Batter his
## shield instead and he answers with a quick riposte. Strike from behind or
## from above and his shield doesn't help him. Legend `e`.
