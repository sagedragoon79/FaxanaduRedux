class_name CrystalDwarf
extends Enemy
## A dwarf of Vorrhallow fused with the Everbloom (design bible 7, Vorrhallow). Magenta
## crystal has grown out of his back like a shell and swallowed his right arm.
## He trudges toward you, and with you ahead of him he raises the crystal fist
## (it brightens: the telegraph) and drives it into the floor. A chain of crystal
## spikes erupts along the floor toward you, one after another: jump them. His
## fist stays rooted for a moment after, and that is the time to hit him. His
## crystal back turns any blow from behind; only a pogo from above gets past it.
