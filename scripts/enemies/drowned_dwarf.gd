class_name DrownedDwarf
extends Enemy
## A Drowned Dwarf of the Mist (design bible 7): one of the Victim miners the
## marsh took, risen with the anchor he was drowned on. He lies sunk in the mire
## with only his helm's crest and a trickle of bubbles showing; he can't be hit
## and does no harm there. Come within about five tiles and he hauls himself
## out (0.7 s, half again damage while half out of the mud), then shambles after
## you. Close in, he heaves the anchor overhead, water pouring off it, for 0.6 s
## (the telegraph), and brings it down in front of him for 18. The slam can be
## parried. It buries the anchor in the mud for 0.8 s, when every blow lands at
## half again. Lose him for 3 s and he sinks back into the mire to wait.
## Legend `p`.
