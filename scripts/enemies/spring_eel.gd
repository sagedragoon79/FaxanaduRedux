class_name SpringEel
extends Enemy
## A Spring Eel of the Sunken Spring (design bible 7): a long pale eel gone
## blind in the dark water, with a lamp of the spring's light grown at the tip
## of a lure that arches from its brow over its snout. It never leaves the water. It weaves back and forth near where it
## lives; come within about seven tiles and it draws back into an S, its lamp
## blazing, for 0.5 s (the telegraph), then darts straight at where you were
## and bites for 14. The dart stops dead at the water's edge, so the bank is
## safe. Spent, it hangs slack for 0.8 s and takes every blow at half again.
## Legend `l` (a cell of water with the eel in it).
