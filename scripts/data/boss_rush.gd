class_name BossRush
extends RefCounted
## The boss rush (design bible 11): a whole clear at 100% (the `lord` flag)
## opens it at the Guru of the Temple of Mantras. The mantra carries you through
## every boss of the Tree in the order you met them, each in its own arena,
## entered by the door you first came in by. Between fights the mantra mends a
## third of your health and all your magic. Nothing is won again: no rings,
## keys or skill points, and the Evil One's death plays no ending. A blow that
## would kill you ends the rush instead and returns you to the Guru, whole. The
## clock runs from the first arena to the last blow; the best time is kept with
## the trials' (`GameState.data.trials`, under RECORD).
##
## Heard (pass 157): between fights the arenas play the trials' theme, the
## mantra-space carrying you on, and each boss brings its own music when it
## rises. A boss down rings the bronze bell soft as the mantra mends you
## (rush_mend); the win rings it three times up the chord (rush_won); a fall
## tolls it low (rush_fall).

## Boss id and its arena, in the order of the critical path (bible 4.2), the
## Drowned Warden of the optional Sunken Spring before Zenis.
