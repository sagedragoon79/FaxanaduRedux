class_name EdgeShade
extends Node2D
## Ambient-occlusion rim shading on every solid edge that meets open air (design
## bible 12.3). Before this, a lit wall, floor or platform tile ran at full
## brightness right up to its boundary with the dark background, so it read as a
## sticker laid on the backdrop. Now the air-facing rim of each solid tile is
## darkened with a short gradient that fades inward, so the surface curves away
## into shadow at its edge and reads as a lit volume:
##
## - the **underside** of ledges and platforms darkens most (it faces away from
##   the top-left key light, design bible 12.3);
## - the **vertical faces** of walls darken moderately;
## - the **walking surface** on top darkens only faintly, so the lit top edge the
##   player reads as footing is kept.
##
## Concave corners deepen for free where two rims overlap. The lit centre of a
## solid mass and the open middle of a room are left untouched, so the gameplay
## layer keeps its contrast and combat readability is unchanged. It draws over
## the tiles but under the actors, once per room load, and costs nothing per
## frame.
##
## The room's outer boundary is treated as more solid (not air), so the frame of
## a room is never rimmed. A secret wall the player later breaks open is a rare
## case the static shade does not redraw for; the reveal flash covers it.
